<h1>My favorite tv shows of all time</h1>

<h2>My all-time comfort series.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Derry Girls</h3>
<p>How can you not love it? This series hase 'show, dont't tell' down to a t, and oodles of humor to boot. Now, swear on Dolly you'll schedule a rewatch soon!</p>

<h3>Arrested Development</h3>
<p>It took me some time to get into this show, but my goodness is it great! Attention to detail, running gags, and way more depth than I initially thought. Favorite quote: "If that is a veiled criticism about me, I won't hear it and I won't respond to it." Words to live by, truly. </p>

<h3>Schitt's Creek</h3>
<p>Ew, David! What do you mean you don't like this show?! You cannot help fall in love with these characters. This series is extremely quotable (and memeable), but to name a few favorite quotes:<br />
"Eat glass!"<br />
"Lick rust!"<br />
"I don't skate through life, David. I walk through life. In really nice shoes."<br />
And, quite frankly, all of 'A little bit Alexis'.</p>
